## 📖 Overview

**CryptoRiskAnalysis** is a high-performance, full-stack application designed to deliver institutional-grade risk metrics for digital assets. By leveraging a **Hybrid Data Engine**, it seamlessly aggregates real-time market data from **Binance Spot API** and **CoinGecko**, providing robust volatility tracking, trend analysis, and advanced financial indicators.

Built with **.NET 8 Clean Architecture** and a responsive **React/TypeScript** frontend, the platform ensures low-latency calculations and a premium user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Hybrid Data Engine
- **Smart Routing**: Intelligently routes data requests to the Binance Spot API for high-frequency assets (1-min cache) and falls back to CoinGecko for long-tail markets (3-min cache).
- **Resiliency**: Built-in circuit breakers and automatic failover mechanisms ensure continuous operation even during API outages.

### 📊 Advanced Risk Metrics
- **Volatility Analysis**: Log-returns based annualized volatility calculation for precise risk measurement.
- **Institutional Indicators**:
  - **VaR (95%)**: Value at Risk estimation for downside protection.
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return performance evaluation.
  - **Max Drawdown**: Historical worst-case loss tracking.
  - **Downside Risk**: Focuses exclusively on negative return variance.

### ⚡ High-Performance Architecture
- **Optimized Backend**: Parallel processing and in-memory caching for sub-100ms response times.
- **Modern Frontend**: Interactive visualizations powered by Recharts and Tailwind CSS.
- **Asset Coverage**: Support for top 20 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and more.

## 📐 Risk Calculation Methodology

The platform employs industry-standard financial models adapted for the crypto market.

### Core Scoring (0-100 Scale)

1.  **Volatility Score (40%)**: Derived from annualized standard deviation of daily log returns.
    -   Formula: `σ_annual = σ_daily × √365`
2.  **Trend Score (30%)**: Momentum analysis comparing 7-day vs 30-day moving averages to detect extreme deviations.
3.  **Volume Score (30%)**: Liquidity risk assessment based on volume-to-price divergence analysis.

### Advanced Metrics

-   **Sharpe Ratio**: `(μ - r_f) / σ × √365` (using 0% risk-free rate)
-   **Downside Risk**: `√(Σ(min(r_i, 0))² / (n-1))` (Semideviation)
-   **Maximum Drawdown**: `MDD = max(1 - P_t / max(P_0...P_t))`
-   **Value at Risk (VaR 95%)**: 5th percentile of return distribution (Historical Simulation)
